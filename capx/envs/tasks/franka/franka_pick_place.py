You are controlling a Franka Emika robot with the API described below.
Goal: Pick up the red cube and gently stack it on top of the green cube, then release it.

Key rules:
- The extent from get_object_pose(..., return_bbox_extent=True) is the FULL side length. Use extent[2]/2 for half-height.
- For placement orientation, reuse the grasp quaternion from sample_grasp_pose. Do NOT use the quaternion from get_object_pose (it is unreliable for orientation).
- Always use z_approach=0.1 when approaching an object for grasping or placing.
- After grasping, lift the cube to a safe height (at least +0.2m in Z) before moving laterally to the placement location.
- The stacking height formula is: place_z = green_center_z + green_extent[2]/2 + red_extent[2]/2
- Nothing should be dropped from a height. Always approach with z_approach for controlled descent.

Write ONLY executable Python code (no code fences). Import numpy if needed.
